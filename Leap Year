#Ask user to enter a date

year=int(input("Please enter the year"))\
#if leap year is divisible by 400, is a leap year
if year % 400 ==0:
    print (year, "Is a Leap Year")
#if leap year is divisible by 100, is not a leap year
elif year % 100 == 0:
    print (year, "Is not a Leap Year")
#if leap year is divisibile by 4, is a leap year
elif year % 4 == 0:
    print (year, "Is a Leap Year")
#else everything other year will not be a leap year
else:
    print (year, "Is not a Leap Year")
#will ask user the year and will define if or if not the year is a leap year.
